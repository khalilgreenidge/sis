# BCC Tutor Portal
This project contains a web-based Student Information System (SIS), similar to Moodle. This was created to allow tutor and students to interact online whether it be uploading assignments, viewing submissions, registering students, adding students to a class etc. This project was created using PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# Assumptions
Kindly note, this is the static version of the website to show the key functionality. Therefore, all forms submissions will not save, as I have disconnected the database functionality just to show you how it looks.

# How to view the pages
First, go to login.php then click login. The form has been prefilled. When you login, you are taken to the tutor's dashboard. From there, select a course, then click any of the options in the side navigation. Have a go at it, and share you thoughts. Enjoy!
